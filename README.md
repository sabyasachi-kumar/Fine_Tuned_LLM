# Fine_Tuned_LLM
**Description:**
This code fine-tunes the Llama2 model on a custom dataset, enabling it to answer technical electrical substation queries. The process involves generating diverse prompt/response pairs, training the model, and testing its ability to provide accurate information about substation-related topics. The final fine-tuned model, "llama-2-7b-custom," integrates Llama2's capabilities with enhanced substation-specific knowledge.
